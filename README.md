## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Accessibility


### What I learned

Through this challenge I have learnt a lot of aspects regarding the accessibility and that how to use the aria-annotations properly. Though the data in this solution could have been dynamically picked from the JSON file but I preferred to do it otherwise, and that's because I wanted to make use of tablist in this solution. The javascript part was a bit tricky but not hard and I have also added the navigation with arrow keys. I had a great learning experience and really enjoyed working on this solution.


### Continued development

Since this challenge has a JSON file for loading data dynamically, so I intend to do it next time using the dynamic data loading. While re doing this challenge in future, I will be planning on how can I achieve the accessibility with a little change in the HTML structure.
